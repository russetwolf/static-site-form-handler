# static-site-form-handler
A serverless backend that enables form submissions from static websites. Frontend JavaScript sends form data to an API Gateway endpoint, which triggers an AWS Lambda function that formats and sends the submission via email using AWS SES. Useful for marketing sites, product pages, or contact forms that donâ€™t require a full backend.
